This recipe will make 2 loaves:

1.5 c water
3 T oil
1.5 T molasses
1.5 T sugar
2.25 t salt
.5 c cooked oatmeal
4.5 c flour
1 T yeast (heaping)

In the bread machine, I add the ingredients in that order, press the “dough” button, and in 2 hours it dings :)

When I made this bread at camp, I would proof the yeast in a bowl of lukewarm water + sugar. Mix the oatmeal, salt, oil, and  molasses…then add yeast mixture…. in large  bowl and mix with with dough hook; gradually add in flour until dough pulls away from bowl. (At camp, I always needed more flour than was called for). Plop out onto floured surface and knead briefly. Put all into a bowl rubbed with oil. Cover with cloth and let rise til double in size (20-60 min depending on how warm the room is).

Punch down and plop onto flour covered surface. Knead briefly. Cut into 2. Put each into greased bread tins. Cover with towel and let rise until doubled.

Bake 350 for 20 minutes until golden.

Enjoy!

Additional notes: We always used the leftover oatmeal from breakfast. When I do this at home, I cook up a batch of oatmeal, then scoop by 1/2 cupfuls into a muffin tin and freeze. I then store the frozen “pucks” and thaw individually as needed.
