INGREDIENTS:

‘Ginger Bug’ Ingredients (First Day):

2 cups (500ml) filtered water

2 Tbsp (22g) finely chopped or grated ginger (skin on is fine)

2 Tbsp (28g) granulated sugar

1 tsp of Yeast


Ginger bug feeding (every 24 hours):

2 Tbsp (22g) finely chopped or grated ginger (skin on is fine)

2 Tbsp (28g) granulated sugar


Ginger Beer:

2 quarts filtered water

1 1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp (273g) granulated sugar *see notes*

1/4 cup (54g) ginger, grated

1/2 cup (110g) strained ginger bug liquid

*optional* Juice of 3 lemons


*notes on sugar in ginger beer: You're welcome to make the ginger beer much less sweet if you prefer. I would say the lowest you can go on sugar is 1/2 cup (170g).



INSTRUCTIONS:

Method:

To cultivate your own wild yeast, combine filtered water with granulated sugar, finely chopped ginger and place in a 1-quart glass/plastic container.

Mix together until the sugar is dissolved, and cover with a cheesecloth. Let it sit for 24 hours.

Moving forward, add the same amount of ginger and sugar every 24 hours until it becomes fizzy. This should take about 2-3 days.

Once the ginger bug is fizzy, pour 2 quarts of water into a large pot. To that, in granulated sugar and grated ginger. Bring up to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer and let it sit for 5-8 minutes. Let it cool down naturally until it reaches room temperature, leaving all of the ingredients in there to steep.

Once it’s up to room temperature, strain your liquid through a fine mesh colander. Make sure to press out the juices.

Next, add in ½ cup of your strained ginger bug and the juice of 3 lemons. Mix together until thoroughly combined and transfer that mixture to some flip-top bottles. Make sure to leave 2 inches of head room.

Let them sit out at room temperature with the flip bottle tops locked, for 3-6 days or until they’re fizzy.

Once they’ve reached that point, you can refrigerate them; but make sure you’re opening the top and burping them once a day.
