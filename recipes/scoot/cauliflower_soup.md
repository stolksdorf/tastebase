1. Pour in {5 cups of broth}, scrape the bottom. Add in the cashews, cauliflower, {2 cans of cannellini beans}, {5 tbsp of nutrional yeast}, and salt and pepper. Gently tuck the bouquet garni into the broth.
1. Bring the soup to a boil. Then reduce the heat to maintain a rapid simmer and cook for 15-30 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender and soft.
1. Remove the bouquet garni and transfer the soup to a stand blender (you will need to do this in two batches). Blend until smooth, thick, and creamy.
